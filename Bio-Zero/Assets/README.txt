Thanks for purchasing Awesome Crosshairs!


You may notice a difference in the size of the crosshairs.
 
This was done to give each category its own look dependent on the weapon class. 
For example the heavy weapons have a bigger crosshair compared to that of a pistol or a submachine gun.

Feel free to use the crosshairs for whatever you like. The naming and weapon classes are meant as a guide for people that are maybe unsure about which crosshair to use on a particular weapon.



Since I put a lot of hours into this I would appreciate if you wouldn´t publish those images anywhere else online. Also feedback and criticism is always highly appreciated!



Like always. Have Fun with this!

STAY AWESOME and keep creatin´.
